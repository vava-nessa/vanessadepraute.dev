      "I'm a **freelance full-stack developer** based in Paris, France, building web and mobile experiences since 2006. Over the years, I've had the chance to work with major companies as well as startups.",
      "I love turning ideas into real, working things. Whether it's crafting a slick UI, architecting a complex backend, or solving tricky problems with code: I'm in. These days, I'm especially excited about **Next.js**, **React Native**, and exploring how AI is reshaping the way we build software.",
      "I'm currently working on my own project called Out Of Burn: a wellness coaching app for **web, iOS, and Android** designed to help people recover from and prevent burnout.",
      "When I'm not coding, I'm probably making electronic music with Ableton Live and way too many VSTs, reading AI research papers, or cuddling my cats. There's something about sound design that scratches the same creative itch as programming.",
