## Notes & Ideas (To Organize)

### Potential Opportunities

* **Vercel**: Questions about data indexing architecture, multi-source synchronization, real-time updates, performance optimization for large datasets
* Interest in French data sovereignty issues with language-agnostic AI
* Experience with Cursor/Copilot/Windsurf AI tools
* Observation: Initial friction when starting projects, but massive time gains afterward
* Suggestion: Focus on reducing friction to decrease early user drop-off

### UI/UX Ideas

* Custom buttons/shortcuts instead of natural language for common tasks: "morning overview", "weekly overview", "project status"
* Proactive suggestion system: AI analyzes history and context to automatically propose actions
* Gamification for non-technical users
* Demo/wizard improvements

### Areas of Interest

* Tickets and project management
* Analytics insights
* Data indexing and search optimization
* Real-time systems
* Performance optimization
