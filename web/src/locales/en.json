My goal is to make technical concepts accessible to everyone, using a friendly and creative approach. Whether you're a developer, a startup founder, or even my grandma — I want you to understand what I do and why I love doing it!"

        "question": "Have you always been a developer?",

These experiences helped me grow both technically and interpersonally. Eventually, I decided to go independent, which motivated me to go back to school and sharpen my skills. For the past years, I've been a **full-time freelance developer**, and I couldn't be happier!"
      },
      {
        "question": "What does a typical day look like for you?",
        "answer": "My day usually starts with a cup of green tea ☕ and catching up on the latest tech news. If I'm working with a team, there's often a quick **daily standup** to align on tasks. Then it's all about prioritizing — thinking through problems, researching solutions, and of course, **coding**. I push my work to shared repos, review code, and iterate. Oh, and there's always time for cuddling my cats between commits!"
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes you different from other developers?",
        "answer": "A developer is like a **digital architect** who structures applications to deliver the best user experience. There are many programming languages out there, each with its own strengths. My specialty? **JavaScript & TypeScript**. As a **Full-Stack developer**, I handle both frontend and backend, plus databases. This means I can deliver **complete, end-to-end solutions** — from sleek UIs to robust APIs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do you have only one public GitHub repo?",
        "answer": "Great question! This portfolio is currently my only **public project** on GitHub. Most of my other work is either confidential or belongs to clients. That said, I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to contribute to **open-source projects** and expand my public portfolio. Stay tuned — more is coming!"
