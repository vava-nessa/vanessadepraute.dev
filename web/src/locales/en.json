Since then, I've accumulated **11+ years of full-stack JavaScript experience**, worked with **50+ enterprise clients**, and even spent 2 years as a WebGL developer at **Kogama/ABOX in Stockholm**. It's been quite a journey!"

        "question": "How do you use AI in your development workflow?",

I'm also experienced with the broader AI ecosystem — **LangChain, vector databases (Pinecone, pgvector)**, and various LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral. This lets me not only code faster but also build **AI-powered features** into the applications I create."
